    # Task 3 - Interacting With Your First Linux Machine (In-Browser)

    > I've deployed my first Linux machine!

    ```

    ```

    # Task 4 - Running Your First few Commands

    > If we wanted to output the text "TryHackMe", what would our command be?

    ```

    ```

    > What is the username of who you're logged in as on your deployed Linux machine?

    ```

    ```

    # Task 5 - Interacting With the Filesystem!

    > On the Linux machine that you deploy, how many folders are there?

    ```

    ```
